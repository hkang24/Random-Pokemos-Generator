# Random-Pokemos-Generator

I made this application to help me learn how to use APIs in web apps. This is a simple application where the user can click the button 'click me'.
When it is pressed, it will pull information about a random pokemon from a pokemon API and provide its name and the effect of the pokemon.

To run the application, simply run the html file.
